Exam Result System
This is a simple Java program that allows users to input a student's name, branch, batch, PRN, and marks for 5 subjects. The program then calculates the percentage of the marks obtained by the student and displays the result.

The program consists of three classes - Exam, Student, and Result. The Exam interface has a method calculatePercent() that is implemented by the Result class to calculate the percentage of marks obtained by the student. The Result class extends the Student class and implements the Exam interface. It takes input for the student's details and marks, calculates the percentage, and displays the result using the display() method of the Student class.

To run the program, simply execute the main() method in the Result class, which creates an instance of the Result class and calls its show() method.
